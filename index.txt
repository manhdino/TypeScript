+ TypeScript 
   + Browner don't understand TS like JS so when we write TS we need complile it down
   into JS 
   + Allow to use strict type:
      + If I declare a variable in typescript to be a certain type like a number 
      + I then can't change that type later running that variable to a string or a boolean or something else
      + That means that all of the error checking process and debugging of our code becomes a little bit easier and it
      + javascript in contrast to that uses dynamic types where variables can change types at any point and that
       could potentially lead to more errors
